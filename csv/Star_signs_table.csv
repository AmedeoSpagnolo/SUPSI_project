Short tempered
Self-involved
Impulsive","Aries is the sign of the self, people born under this sign strongly project
their personalities onto others and can be very self-oriented. Aries tend to
venture out into the world and leave impressions on others that they are
exciting, vibrant and talkative. Aries tend to live adventurous lives and like
to be the center of attention, but rightly so since they are natural, confident
leaders. Aries are enthusiastic about their goals and enjoy the thrill of the
hunt, ""wanting is always better then getting"" is a good way to sum it up.
Aries are very impulsive and usually do not think before they act - or speak.
Too often Aries will say whatever pops into their head and usually end up
regretting it later!"

should some poor souls attempt to provoke Taurus, the wrath will be
known, for they have a temper underneath the calm surface. Taurus are
